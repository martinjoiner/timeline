# Timeline by Martin Joiner

**A meditation aid for people who reminisce** 

This interactive webapp enables you to benefit from seeing the cronology of your life presented visually. Create and browse an interactive graph of the overlapping timespans in your life. Populate the board with data that matters to you: The places you've lived, the people you've loved, your pets, job roles, hobbies or musical tastes.

## The benefits
It is important to be able to vividly recall periods of your life when you were productive and happy, as well as the parts that were not so good. When you paint a full picture in your mind you can help to recreate the great state of mind that was driving you at that time.
