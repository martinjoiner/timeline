== Timeline

A visual taxonomy of your life. The places you've lived, the people you've loved, the jobs you were employed in, the music you danced to. What was a typical week in your life like in March 2003? If you cannot answer that question, but would like to, you need this tool. Recalling your life is healthy, think of it like meditation.
