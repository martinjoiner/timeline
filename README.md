# Timeline

A meditation aid for people who benefit from visual presentation of information. Generates a graphical presentation of the overlapping timespans in your life. Populate with data that matters to you: The places you've lived, the people you've loved, your pets, job roles, hobbies or musical tastes. 

Can you immediately conjure up a typical snapshot of your everyday at any point in the past? If the answer is no, but you would like to, this tool may help.
